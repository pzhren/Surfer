## SeaWave
**SeaWave** is a Robotic Manipulation with Progressive Reasoning Tasks benchmark based on a realistic robotic manipulation simulator. Specifically, the SeaWave benchmark builds a new high-fidelity digital twin scene based on Unreal Engine 5, which includes 40K natural language instructions generated by ChatGPT for a detailed evaluation of robot manipulation.
